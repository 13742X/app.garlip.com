## Snard Tokens & Wallet Setup

### How do I get a wallet for my snard tokens?
To receive your snard tokens, you need a digital wallet that supports the Solana blockchain. We recommend Phantom, which is a secure and user-friendly wallet available for your browser or mobile phone.

Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

**Step 1: Install the Phantom Wallet**

*   **Browser Extension (Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge):**
    1.  Go to the official Phantom download page: [phantom.app/download](https://phantom.app/download).
    2.  Select your browser and follow the instructions to add the extension.

*   **Mobile App (iOS/Android):**
    1.  Open the Apple App Store or Google Play Store on your phone.
    2.  Search for "Phantom" and download the official application.

**Step 2: Create Your New Wallet**

1.  Open the Phantom app or extension you just installed.
2.  Click the "**Create a New Wallet**" button.
3.  You will be shown your **Secret Recovery Phrase** (12 words). This is the master key to your wallet and all of your assets.
4.  **IMPORTANT:** Write this phrase down and store it in a secure, offline location where only you can find it. **Never share this phrase with anyone.** If you lose it, you will lose access to your wallet forever.
5.  You will be asked to confirm the phrase. Once done, your wallet is set up.

**Step 3: Find and Use Your Wallet Address**

1.  Open your Phantom wallet.
2.  Your wallet address is the long string of letters and numbers shown at the top. It will look something like `Abc123...xyz789`.
3.  Click on this address to copy it.
4.  This is the address you will provide to receive your snard tokens.
